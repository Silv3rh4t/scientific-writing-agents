# SpectreBot: AI Political Research Assistant

SpectreBot is an experimental, modular AI-powered assistant for political science research and article drafting. It guides users through a rigorous, multi-stage workflowâ€”from hypothesis validation to literature review, drafting, and critiqueâ€”using state-of-the-art LLMs and a clean, interactive Streamlit UI.

## ðŸš¦ Project Status: Architecture Experimentation
> **Note:** This project is in active development. I am experimenting with different architectural patterns and abstractions to identify the most robust, maintainable, and extensible design for multi-agent LLM workflows.

## Features
- **Stepwise Research Pipeline:**
  - Premise & hypothesis validation
  - Literature search & evidence gathering
  - Thematic literature review
  - Drafting of academic articles
  - Automated critique and editorial feedback
- **Modular Agent Design:** Each research stage is encapsulated in its own agent class, with prompts and logic separated for easy experimentation.
- **User-Editable Intermediates:** Users can review and edit outputs at every stage for maximum control and transparency.
- **Prompt Engineering Friendly:** All LLM prompts are stored as external templates for rapid iteration.
- **Secure & Clean:** Secrets are managed via `.env`

## Quickstart
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo-url>
   cd spectrebot
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure API keys:**
   - Add your OpenRouter API key to `.env`:
     ```
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-...
     ```
4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

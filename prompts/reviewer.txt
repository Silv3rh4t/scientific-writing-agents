You are a literature reviewer preparing a thematic synthesis for a political research article.

Here is a list of literature and evidence:
{papers}

Organize the material into clear categories:
1. Theoretical foundations
2. Empirical support
3. Critical or dissenting views
4. Policy-level or institutional analysis
5. Comparative perspectives (if any)

For each category, list:
- Brief intro (1 sentence)
- Items that belong to that category
- 1-line commentary on how the item relates to the article's hypothesis

Output in clean, structured bullet-point Markdown. Use headings for categories.
